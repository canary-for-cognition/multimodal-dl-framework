# Dataset

This dataset is based on a study involving a base group of 189 participants, for whom data was recorded in terms of
eye-tracking and audio. All the information related to the experiment is stored at `metadata_participants_log.csv`,
which also provide the ground truth for each participant (i.e., whether it is considered a `Patient` or
a `Healthy Control`).

## Tasks

Data for Alzheimerâ€™s prediction was collected based on the following tasks that patients performed during the
experiments.

| Name              | Description                                                  | ID in dataset       | ID in metadata |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Cookie Theft      | Describing a picture (involving some kids stealing a cookie from a jar) while looking at it | `cookie_theft`      | `CookieTheft`  |
| Reading           | Reading aloud a text                                         | `reading`           | `Reading`      |
| Memory            |                                                              |                     | `Memory`               |
| Pupil calibration | Staring at a cross place at the centre of the screen to calibrate the eye-tracker | `pupil_calibration` | `PupilCalib`   |

## Data

### Eye-tracking

Data recorded using the eye-tracker is provided by participant, not by task. For each participant, data related to a
specific task can be identified using the timestamps provided in `metadata/timestamps.csv`.
